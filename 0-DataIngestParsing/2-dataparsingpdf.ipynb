(the “Bank”) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “group”) as at 31 March\\n2025 which comprise the condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position as at 31 March\\n2025 and the related condensed consolidated interim statement of income, condensed consolidated interim\\nstatement of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated interim statement of cash flows and\\ncondensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity for the three-month period then ended and\\nexplanatory notes.\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated interim\\nfinancial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34, Interim Financial\\nReporting (“IAS 34”). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this condensed consolidated interim\\nfinancial statements based on our review.\\nScope of review\\nWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410,Review\\nof Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity . A review of\\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons\\nresponsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A\\nreview is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on\\nAuditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all\\nsignificant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\\nConclusion\\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying\\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in\\naccordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.\\nOther Matter\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group as of 31 March 2024 were reviewed\\nby another auditor whose report dated 24 April 2024 expressed an unmodified conclusion on those\\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements. Also, the consolidated financial statements as of\\n31 December 2024, were audited by another auditor whose report dated 28 January 2025 expressed an\\nunmodified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\\nErnst & Young Middle East (Dubai Branch)\\nAnthony O’Sullivan\\nRegistration No: 687\\n21 April 2025\\nDubai, United Arab Emirates'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creationdate': '2025-04-16T12:53:31+04:00', 'moddate': '2025-04-21T12:56:58+04:00', 'source': 'data/pdf/emirates_nbd_financial_statements_q1_2025_english.pdf', 'total_pages': 32, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='21 APR 2025'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creationdate': '2025-04-16T12:53:31+04:00', 'moddate': '2025-04-21T12:56:58+04:00', 'source': 'data/pdf/emirates_nbd_financial_statements_q1_2025_english.pdf', 'total_pages': 32, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='3  \\nEMIRATES NBD BANK (P.J.S.C.) \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\nGROUP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM STATEMENT OF INCOME \\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2025 (UNAUDITED) \\n \\nThe attached notes 1 to 2 5 form an integral part of these Group condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

IAS 29 requires non-monetary assets and liabilities of DenizBank A.S.(‘DenizBank’), the Group’s \\nsubsidiary in Türkiye, to be restated to reflect their current prices using the Consumer Pricing Index \\n(CPI) in the local currency of DenizBank before translation to the Group’s functional currency .  \\n \\nAs at 31 March 2025, the three-year cumulative inflation rate has been 250% based on the Turkish CPI. \\nThe consumer price index at the beginning of the reporting period was 2,685 and closed at 2,955 \\nresulting in an increase of 10% (31 March 2024:15%). \\n- Net non-monetary position (excluding equity) has been indexed by applying the difference in CPI \\nfrom 31 December 2024 to 31 March 2025 resulting in a gain of AED 0.5 billion (31 March 2024: \\nAED 0.7 billion) in the Group condensed consolidated interim statement  of income to the extent \\ndetermined to be recoverable. \\n \\n- Monetary assets and liabilities are already reported at the current measuring unit and are not \\nadjusted for inflation. However, the CPI index is applied to measure the loss of purchasing power \\nand for the net monetary position, a hyperinflation adjustment is made in the Group condensed \\nconsolidated interim statement of income, amounting to AED 1.5 billion (31 March 2024: AED 1.4 \\nbillion) with an equal corresponding credit to OCI. \\n \\n- Group condensed consolidated interim statement of income is indexed using the respective period \\nindex movement for the period. For the period ended 31 March 2025, the indexation impact on the \\nGroup condensed consolidated interim statement of income is as follows: \\n   \\n 31 March 2025 31 March 2024 \\n31 March 2025 \\nIn AED billion \\nHyperinflation \\nImpact  \\nHyperinflation \\nImpact  \\nTotal operating income (0.01) 0.08 \\nGeneral administrative expenses (0.06) (0.04) \\nNet impairment loss on financial assets (0.02) 0.05 \\nTaxation charge 0.01 0.08 \\n \\nDuring the three months period ended 31 March 2025, the loss due to hyperinflation accounting for \\nDenizBank was AED 0.9 billion (31 March 2024: AED 0.9 billion) and is recognised in the Group \\ncondensed consolidated interim statement of income as hyperinfla tion adjustment on net monetary \\nposition. Overall, the hyperinflation adjustment results in a credit of AED 0.7 billion (AED 31 March \\n2024: AED 0.7 billion) in OCI after netting off loss on net monetary position recognised in the Group \\ncondensed consolidated interim statement of income. \\n \\nThe positive impact of 31 bps, arising from the AED 3.2 billion non-monetary items credit adjustment \\nto equity partially offset by AED 5. 2 billion indexation impact on risk -weighted assets, has been \\nexcluded from the capital adequacy computations.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creationdate': '2025-04-16T12:53:31+04:00', 'moddate': '2025-04-21T12:56:58+04:00', 'source': 'data/pdf/emirates_nbd_financial_statements_q1_2025_english.pdf', 'total_pages': 32, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content='9  \\nEMIRATES NBD BANK (P.J.S.C.) \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\nNOTES TO THE GROUP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2025 (UNAUDITED)  \\n \\n \\n3      CASH AND DEPOSITS WITH CENTRAL BANKS \\n \\nThe reserve requirements which are kept with the Central Banks of the countries in which the Group \\noperates are not available for use in the Group’s day to day operations and cannot be withdrawn \\nwithout the approval of the respective Central Banks.

Favourable and unfavourable changes in the value of financial instruments are \\ndetermined on the basis of changes in the value of the instruments as a result of varying the levels of \\nthe unobservable parameters, quantification of which is judgmental. \\n \\nDuring the period ended 31 March 2025 and the year ended 31 December 202 4, no financial assets \\nmeasured at fair value were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 1 (2024: AED \\nNil). \\n \\nFor comparative information please refer to the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year \\nended 31 December 2024. \\n  \\n \\nTrading \\nsecurities \\nat FVTPL  \\nDesignated \\n at FVTPL  \\nFVOCI – \\ndebt \\ninstrument  \\nFVOCI– \\nequity \\ninstrument  Total \\n AED million  AED million  AED million  AED million  AED million \\nBalance as at 1 January 2025 -

(the “Bank”) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “group”) as at 31 March\\n2025 which comprise the condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position as at 31 March\\n2025 and the related condensed consolidated interim statement of income, condensed consolidated interim\\nstatement of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated interim statement of cash flows and\\ncondensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity for the three-month period then ended and\\nexplanatory notes.\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidated interim\\nfinancial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34, Interim Financial\\nReporting (“IAS 34”). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this condensed consolidated interim\\nfinancial statements based on our review.\\nScope of review\\nWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, Review\\nof Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of\\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons\\nresponsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A\\nreview is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on\\nAuditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all\\nsignificant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\\nConclusion\\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying\\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in\\naccordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting.\\nOther Matter\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group as of 31 March 2024 were reviewed\\nby another auditor whose report dated 24 April 2024 expressed an unmodified conclusion on those\\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements. Also, the consolidated financial statements as of\\n31 December 2024, were audited by another auditor whose report dated 28 January 2025 expressed an\\nunmodified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\\nErnst & Young Middle East (Dubai Branch)\\nAnthony O’Sullivan\\nRegistration No: 687\\n21 April 2025\\nDubai, United Arab Emirates'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creationdate': '2025-04-16T12:53:31+04:00', 'source': 'data/pdf/emirates_nbd_financial_statements_q1_2025_english.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/pdf/emirates_nbd_financial_statements_q1_2025_english.pdf', 'total_pages': 32, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-04-21T12:56:58+04:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250421125658+04'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250416125331+04'00'\", 'page': 3}, page_content='21 APR 2025'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creationdate': '2025-04-16T12:53:31+04:00', 'source': 'data/pdf/emirates_nbd_financial_statements_q1_2025_english.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/pdf/emirates_nbd_financial_statements_q1_2025_english.pdf', 'total_pages': 32, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-04-21T12:56:58+04:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250421125658+04'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250416125331+04'00'\", 'page': 4}, page_content='3 \\nEMIRATES NBD BANK (P.J.S.C.) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nGROUP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM STATEMENT OF INCOME \\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2025 (UNAUDITED) \\n \\nThe attached notes 1 to 25 form an integral part of these Group condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

IAS 29 requires non-monetary assets and liabilities of DenizBank A.S.(‘DenizBank’), the Group’s \\nsubsidiary in Türkiye, to be restated to reflect their current prices using the Consumer Pricing Index \\n(CPI) in the local currency of DenizBank before translation to the Group’s functional currency.  \\n \\nAs at 31 March 2025, the three-year cumulative inflation rate has been 250% based on the Turkish CPI. \\nThe consumer price index at the beginning of the reporting period was 2,685 and closed at 2,955 \\nresulting in an increase of 10% (31 March 2024:15%). \\n- \\nNet non-monetary position (excluding equity) has been indexed by applying the difference in CPI \\nfrom 31 December 2024 to 31 March 2025 resulting in a gain of AED 0.5 billion (31 March 2024: \\nAED 0.7 billion) in the Group condensed consolidated interim statement of income to the extent \\ndetermined to be recoverable. \\n \\n- \\nMonetary assets and liabilities are already reported at the current measuring unit and are not \\nadjusted for inflation. However, the CPI index is applied to measure the loss of purchasing power \\nand for the net monetary position, a hyperinflation adjustment is made in the Group condensed \\nconsolidated interim statement of income, amounting to AED 1.5 billion (31 March 2024: AED 1.4 \\nbillion) with an equal corresponding credit to OCI. \\n \\n- \\nGroup condensed consolidated interim statement of income is indexed using the respective period \\nindex movement for the period.

The Group employs valuation techniques, depending on the instrument type and \\navailable market data. For example, in the absence of an active market, an investment’s fair value is \\nestimated on the basis of an analysis of the investee’s financial position and results, risk profile and \\nother factors. Favourable and unfavourable changes in the value of financial instruments are \\ndetermined on the basis of changes in the value of the instruments as a result of varying the levels of \\nthe unobservable parameters, quantification of which is judgmental. \\n \\nDuring the period ended 31 March 2025 and the year ended 31 December 2024, no financial assets \\nmeasured at fair value were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 1 (2024: AED \\nNil). \\n \\nFor comparative information please refer to the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year \\nended 31 December 2024. \\n \\n \\nTrading \\nsecurities \\nat FVTPL \\nDesignated \\n at FVTPL \\nFVOCI – \\ndebt \\ninstrument \\nFVOCI– \\nequity \\ninstrument \\nTotal \\nAED million \\nAED million \\nAED million \\nAED million \\nAED million \\nBalance as at 1 January 2025 \\n-  \\n65  \\n-  \\n206  \\n271 \\nTotal gains or losses: \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n-     in profit or loss \\n-  \\n-  \\n-  \\n-  \\n- \\n-     in other comprehensive \\n      income \\n-  \\n-  \\n-  \\n(2)  \\n(2) \\nPurchases \\n-  \\n-  \\n-  \\n-  \\n- \\nSettlements and other \\nadjustments \\n-  \\n-  \\n-  \\n-  \\n- \\nBalance as at 31 March  \\n2025 (unaudited) \\n-  \\n65  \\n-  \\n204  \\n269 \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\nBalance as at 31 December  \\n2024 (audited) \\n-  \\n65  \\n-  \\n206  \\n271'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creationdate': '2025-04-16T12:53:31+04:00', 'source': 'data/pdf/emirates_nbd_financial_statements_q1_2025_english.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/pdf/emirates_nbd_financial_statements_q1_2025_english.pdf', 'total_pages': 32, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-04-21T12:56:58+04:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250421125658+04'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250416125331+04'00'\", 'page': 30}, page_content='29 \\nEMIRATES NBD BANK (P.J.S.C.) \\n \\n \\n \\nNOTES TO THE GROUP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2025 (UNAUDITED)  \\n \\n \\n24    RISK MANAGEMENT \\n \\nThe Group financial risk management objectives and policies are consistent with those disclosed in the \\nconsolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2024. \\n \\n \\nStage-wise financing exposures and the related Expected Credit Losses (ECL) as at 31 March 2025 and \\n31 March 2024 are given below: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLoans and receivables \\nUnaudited 31 March 2025 \\n12-month ECL \\nLifetime ECL \\nnot credit-\\nimpaired\\nLifetime ECL \\ncredit-impaired\\nTotal \\nAED million \\nAED million\\nAED million\\nAED million \\nBalance at 1 January  \\n        486,412     \\n          25,128    \\n          17,639 \\n        529,179 \\nTransfers from stage 1 \\n           (6,010)    \\n            6,010    \\n                  -
