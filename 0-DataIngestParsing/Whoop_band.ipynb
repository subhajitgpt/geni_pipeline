During these running workouts, your max heart rate is approximately 168.49 beats per minute, indicating that you are pushing your cardiovascular fitness to its peak. The strain from your activity totals around 7.8 and you're burning an average of 241.15 calories per session. This means that you average about 6.64 calories burned per minute. \n",

This can help improve your max heart rate. Additionally, try to aim for a balanced meal post-run, which can help recover muscles and replenish energy more effectively. Keep up the impressive work!\n"
